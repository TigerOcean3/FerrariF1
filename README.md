Project Desciption:
My website is to show viewer the Ferrari Formula One Team. You can view the current drivers (Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton) but also the legends before them. You can see the history of the team as well. I wanted this website to have a lot of pictures and aesthetic. 

External technology: BootStrap
I used BootStrap in my website to help we with the NavBar. BootStrap is helpful for new coders who are interested in making a website but need starting code. BootStrap provides code for many things to help coders make there website unquie and differet.

Issues/Improvements:
I would like to improve the teams page by adding the team princeable and other main team member. I did not do it this time because I was hard to find the people I wanted to put in.
